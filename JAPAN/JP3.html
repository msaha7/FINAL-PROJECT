				<h1>You start drawing more and more and end up falling in love with the pen and the paint on the canvas. But at the same time, your GPA falls from 3.9 to 3.8. Your dad checks your grades every day at work. After not seeing your dad for 4 days, you go in for a hug around his torso, but he then decides to grab your forehead and pushes you to the floor. He starts scolding you because the minuscule GPA change and starts diminishing your academic ability saying you won't make it in this world. He goes into your to try and find an excuse to blame for your 0.1 GPA drop and comes across your art.  He rips your recently made manga panel and tells you to never draw again in this house. </h1>
