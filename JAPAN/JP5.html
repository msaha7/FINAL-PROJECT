				<h1>You look at the floor with all your precious drawings on the floor, you want to curl up your fist but you can’t, but you know you can’t follow your dictator’s rules. You won't draw in the house, you’ll just draw at the local library. You ask the librarian to watch over your locker with your vaulabes, she looks at your drawing and realizes you have potential, she introduces you to her own personal studio and says you can use it whenever you want. She also recommends you try and publish your drawings online. You do and you start gaining popularity and making a profit. As a curial sacrifice for your passion, your GPA dropped to a 3.6. Your father comes back more furious than ever. He tells you that if your grade drops even by a percentage more, your sleeping on the streets. Your mother is watching and solemnly agrees. </h1>
