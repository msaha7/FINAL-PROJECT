You like drawing but nothing serious. You just stay at school and start blending into the school and start becoming the average student, you really don't have special about yourself, and you still keep your good grades but for what? Your parents have never said they were proud of you anyway. You graduate your high school and decided to go to your average local university and decided to get a basic job as a clerk. Time withers by and you do, you always had the itch to go and try something new but you stay at your average state. You sit in your average apartment as you realize it's too late for yourself.
