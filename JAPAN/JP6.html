FUCK THIS FAMILY! You pack up everything at night and go to the librarian's studio and beg her if she can look over you for a little while. She takes you in but you have to work at the library, clean, and help her from time to time, but you have your own place (kinda). As you reside at the library, you gain so much more following as your drawing gets better. You end up moving in with your librarian until 18 and saving up for a place of your own. You get picked up by Shonen Jump after devoting yourself to your new manga. It blows up and you are one of the few successful manga creators of all time. As you walk into your condo with a smile on your face and full of emotion. You look into the mirror and realize that you made it in life.
