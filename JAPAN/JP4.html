You sit there in since as you obediently follow your father's law, you go back into your room and solemnly pick up your textbooks and get to work. As your GPA goes up, your emotions are dying. You graduate as the Valedictorian of your school, and everyone knows you as someone who loves to study and must be proud of himself. It is the complete opposite. As you now are going to the prestige college across town you wonder how long this rabbit hole goes. You are completely done with life.
