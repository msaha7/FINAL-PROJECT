# FINAL-PROJECT
This Final Project for Art 151 Intro to Creative Coding is meant to be an amalgamation of proof to see I have grown knowledge in the class.

The original project can be found here at https://github.com/msaha7/life

For the original code I made somewhat of a choose your own adventure game for a kid in Ghana but know I want to expand on that topic of opportunites around the world.

Instead of just one kid and his opportunites in around, I want to make the project feel more inclusive and having a meaning at the end that really glues it together.

When you start the adventure, you are given a random senario around the world and you'll choose your path with that charater, and depending on how good or poor you decide to make it, your "EXPIERENCE" for life, which will be a nice graphic or end screen will be different depending on how much you choose on ending up replaying the game and getting good and bad endings.

Ive researched 5 different places and plan to make interesting stories for each charater that gives unique problems for that certain person that you may not have realized. The great thing also about I am also taking inspiration from friends I had over the years help me as they can help give thier input on how they have lived and kind of retell their stories. Ive asked them permission to use some of thier info so everything is all right on thier end. 

I Hope you enjoy!
