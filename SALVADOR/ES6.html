As you sign up for the military, you find out how corrupt they truly are. They take want without actually protecting the citizens at all They live frugally and with fat bellies and comfy beds. In fact, they’re more harm than good as you see this with your own eyes you contemplate if this was really worth it? Yeah, you might be fighting evil, but you’re on the side of another evil. You occasionally get on gun flights with MS-13, but it doesn’t seem to fill the void.
