				<h1>You realize instead of using evil to fight evil itâ€™s better to not partake in any of it in the first place.  You ask forgiveness of your dead mother for not being able to avenge her and run away from the military. You run to Honduras(local country) to avoid MS-13 and the military tries to find you. The rage you once had to seek revenge is gone now. As of now, you are a happy, average, middle-class citizen in Honduras.</h1>
