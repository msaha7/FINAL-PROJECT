You know you can still protect your mother even with these tainted hands. They send you on missions and your start to level up in status in MS-13, you eventually get your mother out of debt. You finally feel proud of yourself. As your next mission is to collect some money from a poor family, you feel sad but are forced to do it. As you knock on the door, a small tween answers it and pulls out a pistol, and shoots you. As life fades from your body, you wonder why you were born here, wishing only you could be born in a better life in the United States. YOu hear over there they have enough food to make them fat. You die with envy and regret in your veins. 
END
