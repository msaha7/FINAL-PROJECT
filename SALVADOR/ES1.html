El Salvador, one of the many small counties in Central America, is known by the outside world for its political corruption and gang violence, it usually forgets the beautiful culture and agriculture El Salvador provides typically. You live with your mother in a small house half a mile away from a town, your father left you all to try to make a life in the amazon united states. But left you and your family in debt with the gang that is controlling the country, (Los Salvatrucha). Your mom has a little food business to try and pay MS-13(Salvatruhcas) but it is barely enough to keep you guys afloat and every single excess Salvadoran Colon(currency) goes to them until you guys pay 87565.67 colons. But you know you’ll never be free from their clutches, you’ll never give up. Your mother wants you to be never involved with Los Salvatruhas ever so she forbids you from ever giving them money to try and repay the debt.
