5- You yell at them saying you’ll never be as cruel and evil as them. They start kicking you and spitting in your face. They start dragging your mother away as another payment for disrespecting them. You cry as you try to pull the Salvatruchas hands off her but you are too weak to do anything. They tell you you need to make up those colons somehow and walk off. As you hear a gunshot off in the distance, you break down and gain rage toward MS-13. As you are now 12 years old, you can be picked up by the military if they decide to, but the government is very corrupt as the Salvatrucha too. But you know you’ll need to gain some type of strength to fight against the Salvatrucha.
