				<h1>As you reluctantly say yes, your mom starts breaking down in despair as another loved one is going to be absorbed by MS-13. They tell you to get into the car and take you for initiation, they make you walk through a whole line of Salvatruchas as they start punching you and your goal is to make it to the end while the higher-ups of the gang watch and determine your performance. You get through it all and they allow you to join. As acceptance, they bring you into a room and start shaving your head and start covering you in tattoos. As having a family member in the gang, the family normally gets protection and watches over them. As you look over your tatted hands. You feel immense guilt for becoming what you hated the most.</h1>
