				<h1>You start asking locals if they need to help labor for some Colon and you start making a few help with the debt, you know you might curse yourself in the future for getting involved with them but as long as you help your loving mother it's fine, now after a while, Los Salvatrchas come to you more and more for money and keep on raising the weekly payment little by little until it is almost impossible to make the payment. You and your mother are skipping meals to barely make the deadline but it's getting impossible. One day they come to you and your mother with a solution, if I were to initiate into MS-13, theyâ€™ll be a little more lineate with the payments. Being a Salvatrucha does come with its benefits but it's signing your life away with them. </h1>
