				<h1>Your morals take over as you realize you shouldn't fight evil with evil. You ask forgiveness of your dead mother for not being able to avenge her and run away from the Salvatrucha. You run to Honduras(local country) to avoid MS-13 as they are known to track down everyone who runs from them. The rage you want to head to seek revenge is gone now. As of now, you are a happy, average, middle-class citizen in Honduras. You are happy with the small money that you are making to keep you afloat.</h1>
