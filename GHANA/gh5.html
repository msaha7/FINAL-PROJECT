The test comes along and it is in the big city hours away so your parents and you worked their asses off so they can send you all the way other there to take the test. AND YOU PASS!

You get enough money for a free ride to college and as soon as you look back at your elderly parents, you promise them you'll be back for them and you'll make them proud
